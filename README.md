- ⚡ Fun fact: Here's a fun fact about web development:
Did you know that the world's first website went live on August 6, 1991?
Created by Tim Berners-Lee, this website provided information about the World Wide Web project and was hosted on a NeXT computer at CERN,
the European Organization for Nuclear Research. It's amazing to think about how far web development has come since then,
evolving into the vast and dynamic digital landscape we interact with today!
